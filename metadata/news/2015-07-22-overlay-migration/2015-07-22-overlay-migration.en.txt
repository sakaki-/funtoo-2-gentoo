Good news! Dantrell B., the GNOME patchset's primary author, is now making
his work directly available for Gentoo users. As such, the 'shim'
functionality provided by this funtoo-2-gentoo overlay is no longer
necessary, and users should migrate to use Dantrell's overlays as soon as
possible.

Dantrell's (top level) page is at:

https://github.com/dantrell/gentoo-project-gnome-without-systemd

and I have put together a short guide on the Gentoo Wiki about getting
his stuff up and running, at:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GNOME/GNOME_Without_systemd

Many thanks to everyone who has used this project and provided feedback!
Please note that while I will leave funtoo-2-gentoo up on GitHub for
historical interest, as of now I am no longer actively developing it.

Any questions, feel free to email me!
